<h1>Python Assignment 3</h1>

<h4>Dictionaries</h4>

<h4>Basic Operations</h4>
<ol>
<li>Create a dictionary student with keys: name, age, and grade. Assign them appropriate values.</li>
<li>Access the value of the key grade in the student dictionary.</li>
<li>Add a new key city to the student dictionary and set its value to "New York".</li>
<li>Update the value of the age key in the student dictionary to 20.</li>
<li>Remove the key city from the student dictionary.</li>
</ol>

<h4>Iterating through Dictionaries</h4>
<ol>
<li>Iterate through the dictionary student and print all keys.
<li>Iterate through the dictionary student and print all values.
<li>Iterate through the dictionary student and print all key-value pairs in the format key: value.
<li>Check if the key grade exists in the student dictionary and print True or False.
<li>Count the total number of keys in the student dictionary.
</ol>

<h4>Advanced Dictionary Usage</h4>
<ol>
<li>Merge the following two dictionaries and print the result: <br>
    dict1 = {'a': 1, 'b': 2} <br>
    dict2 = {'c': 3, 'd': 4}
<li>Create a dictionary from a list of tuples: [('name', 'Alice'), ('age', 25), ('city', 'Paris')].
<li>Sort the keys of the dictionary {'z': 1, 'a': 2, 'c': 3} in ascending order and print the sorted dictionary.
<li>Reverse the dictionary {'a': 1, 'b': 2, 'c': 3} so that keys become values and values become keys.
<li>Write a Python function to check if two dictionaries are identical (contain the same key-value pairs).
</ol>

<h4>Nested Dictionaries</h4>
<ol>
<li>Create a nested dictionary to represent the following data: <br>
    Person: <br>
        Name: John  <br>
        Age: 30  <br>
        Address:  <br>
            Street: 123 Elm St  <br>
            City: Boston  
<li>Access the value of the City key in the nested dictionary from the previous question.
<li>Add a new key Phone to the nested dictionary with the value "123-456-7890".
<li>Delete the Address key from the nested dictionary.
<li>Iterate through all the keys in the outermost level of the nested dictionary and print them.
</ol>

<h4>Applications of Dictionaries</h4>
<ol>
<li>Use a dictionary to count the occurrences of each word in the string "hello world hello python world".
<li>Write a Python program to find the key with the maximum value in the dictionary {'a': 10, 'b': 15, 'c': 7}.
<li>Create a dictionary to map numbers 1 to 5 to their squares (e.g., {1: 1, 2: 4, 3: 9, ...}).
<li>Write a Python program to remove duplicate values from the dictionary {'a': 10, 'b': 15, 'c': 10, 'd': 15}.
<li>Write a Python function that accepts a dictionary and a key, and returns the value associated with the key. If the key doesnâ€™t exist, return "Key not found".
</ol>

<h4>Challenging Problems</h4>
<ol>
<li>Given two dictionaries dict1 = {'a': 5, 'b': 10} and dict2 = {'a': 3, 'b': 7}, write a Python program to add the values of matching keys and print the result.
<li>Write a Python program to create a dictionary where the keys are the first n positive integers, and the values are their cubes. Take n as user input.
<li>Flatten the following nested dictionary into a single-level dictionary: <br>
{'a': {'b': 1, 'c': 2}, 'd': {'e': 3, 'f': 4}}  
<li>Write a Python program to split a dictionary into two based on whether the values are odd or even.
<li>Create a dictionary comprehension to filter out all keys in {'a': 1, 'b': 2, 'c': 3, 'd': 4} where the value is less than 3.
</ol>
